# Clustering-Techniques



#Clustering is a set of techniques that can be used to put data into groups. The three basic types of clustering are partitional clustering (ex. K Means), density-based clustering (ex. DBSCAN), and hierarchical clustering (ex. Agglomerative clustering). In a K-means clustering algorithm, the dataset is divided into a set of k groups and the number of groups is predefined by k. The problem with K-means clustering is that the number of clusters are predefined, and it tries to keep the clusters the same size. Agglomerative clustering solves the limitations of k-means clustering because it follows a bottom-up approach to group the dataset into clusters, it also does not need a predefined number of clusters. DBSCAN clustering creates clusters based on the density of data points in a given area. DBSCAN clustering is slower than k-means and agglomerative clustering, but it can be useful because it can determine which data points are noise/outliers.
